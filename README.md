Mhealthannotator is an RShiny Package used for creating dashboard as a service that can easily visualize Files in Synapse Tables. The goal of this app is to let users be able to easily deploy apps for annotating/labelling data to collaborators more seamlessly. It's used in the mPower and Psorcast project to help create labelled data for analysis and validation to our unlabelled digital health datasets.

### Installation
```r
devtools::install_github("Sage-Bionetworks/mhealthannotator")
```
Notes on Installation:
All functionalities in mhealthannotator use reticulate and the [Synapse Python
client](https://pypi.org/project/synapseclient/). You can set up your environment by having a anaconda environment or a virtual environment set up with Synapseclient. Because mhealthannotator uses reticulate, it is not compatible with the [synapser](https://r-docs.synapse.org/) package..

### Labelling Files in Synapse Tables
Mhealthannotator provides functionality to help label Files in Synapse Tables:

- Able to iteratively parse files (any kind) in batches
- Able to run customized visualization function applied to each Files in Synapse Tables
- Able to be deployred for crowdsourced data labelling for reliability analysis
