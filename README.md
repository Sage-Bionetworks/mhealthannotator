# mhealthannotator

To install the development version from GitHub, run:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Sage-Bionetworks/mhealthannotator")
```

All functionalities in mhealthannotator use reticulate and the [Synapse Python
client](https://pypi.org/project/synapseclient/). You can set up your environment by having a anaconda environment or a virtual environment set up with Synapseclient. Because mhealthannotator uses reticulate, it is not compatible with the [synapser](https://r-docs.synapse.org/) package..
